<p>A movie or a TV show is a financial investment, in which a producer invests money (in the cast,
director, writers, composer, etc.), and expects to maximize profits. A critical decision in a
movie’s making is “who to cast?”. Even though creativity plays a crucial role in the casting
process ­ deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of actors in specific roles ­ the
decisions can be better informed by analyzing historic data. Among the multiple considerations
of the budget, availability, fit, expertise etc., removing some uncertainty from the casting
process can help lead to better investment decisions. CastMe is a tool that will aid the casting
process by predicting the success of a movie that consists of a cast of actors and a specific
genre. Furthermore, CastMe will provide actor recommendations, with the goal to suggest
actors that resemble the ones already selected, however, may lead to a more profitable
movie. At its core, CastMe will use machine­learning techniques, including low­rank
approximations, clustering, prediction and recommendations.<p>
